## Stock Price Prediction with LSTM
This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application that predicts future stock prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The application fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, trains an LSTM model, and predicts the stock price for a user-specified future date. It also provides an interactive visualization of historical and predicted stock prices.

### Features
Stock Ticker Input: Users can input any stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, POWERGRID.NS) to fetch historical data.

Future Date Prediction: Users can specify a future date for which they want to predict the stock price.

LSTM Model: The application uses an LSTM neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

Interactive Visualization: The app provides a plot of historical and predicted stock prices.

Progress Bar and Timer: Displays the training progress of the LSTM model in real-time.

Error Handling: Handles invalid stock tickers and provides user-friendly error messages.
